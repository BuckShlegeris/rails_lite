Rails Lite
=

This is an implementation of some of the features of Rails, written to understand Rails and its implementation of MVC better.

Currently, it supports, with syntax similar but not identical to Rails:

* Controllers
* Views
* Routes with wildcards in them
* render, redirect_to
* link_to, button_to
* session, flash
